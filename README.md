🧠 Python Quiz Game with Leaderboard
This is a fun and interactive Python GUI Quiz Game built using the Tkinter library. The game begins by asking the player's name and then presents 5 random questions selected from a pool of 20 predefined questions. It features a simple user interface, real-time scoring, and saves the player's score along with their name in a local text file named leaderboard.txt. 🏆

The project is designed for beginners looking to practice core Python skills along with GUI development. It includes a Restart button, allowing users to replay the quiz as many times as they like. No external libraries are required — everything runs with standard Python 3 and the built-in Tkinter module. 💻

This project is a part of my #20DaysOfCode challenge and was completed on Day 3. It helped me strengthen my logic-building and GUI design capabilities in Python.
